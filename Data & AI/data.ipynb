This suggests that blood flow to these areas is compromised only during times of increased demand, such as during exercise or stress. Reversible defects can indicate ischemia, which is inadequate blood flow to a region of the heart, possibly due to narrowing or blockages in the coronary arteries.\n",

    "\n",
    "Angina is chest pain that occurs due to insufficient blood flow to the heart, often felt as pressure or squeezing in the chest. It is a symptom of ischemic heart disease and can be triggered by physical activity or stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chest pain type feature varies from 0 to 3.\n",

    "The number 0 to 3 explain 0 is for typical angina, 1 is for atypical angina, 2 is for non-anginal pain, and 3 is for asymptomatic.\n",

    "Typical Angina: This type of chest pain is considered typical because it presents with classic symptoms that are highly indicative of heart problems. People experiencing typical angina are at high risk of having underlying coronary artery disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Atypical Angina: Atypical angina refers to chest pain that doesn't fit the classic description of typical angina. It may not consistently respond to rest or nitroglycerin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-Anginal Pain: This category includes chest discomfort or pain that is not related to coronary artery disease or angina. It could be caused by various factors such as musculoskeletal issues, gastrointestinal problems, anxiety, or respiratory conditions. Non-anginal pain may mimic angina in some cases but is typically not associated with the same underlying heart issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asymptomatic: Asymptomatic means that there are no noticeable symptoms present. In the context of heart disease, it indicates that the individual is not experiencing any chest pain or related symptoms at the time of assessment. However, it's important to note that some people with heart disease may not experience noticeable symptoms, especially in the early stages or if they have other conditions masking the symptoms."
