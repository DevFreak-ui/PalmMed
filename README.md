# palmMed

Welcome to the palmMed repository! This repository contains the code for the API of palmMed, a user-friendly system
with a mobile application and web interface for heart disease prediction and
communication.

**Overview**
palmMed is built using Node.js, react, ai/data-analysis, ml, llm, flutter and Express.js, providing RESTful API endpoints for managing users, appointments, and other functionalities related to the palmMed application.

## Features

- User authentication (signup, login)

* Appointment management (create, read, update, delete)
* User profile management
* Integration with a database (MongoDB)
  **Installation**
  To set up the palmMed backend locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Install dependencies using npm:
